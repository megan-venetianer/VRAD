# VRAD - Vacation Rentals Around Denver


### 1. Abstract

The purpose of this project was to create an application search for properties to rent in different neighborhoods in Denver. The following were learning goals:

1. Write well refactored code using ES6 syntax.
2. Make informed design decisions to create a user-friendly application.
3. Keep state based components to a minimum and leverage more functional components.
4. Use a modular architecture for the application file structure.
5. Think deeply about React Lifecycle Methods.
6. Become familiar with promises, nested fetch requests, and handling the UI based on acceptance of data.
7. Become familiar with routing and how to handle dynamic routes.
8. Use propTypes for every component receiving props.
9. Write tests for React components and some asynchronous functionality using Jest and React Testing Library.
